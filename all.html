            Why Random Chat Was Created?
        </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="introtext">
        <p>
            Random chat services were created to allow people to connect with others from around the world in an
            easy and anonymous way. They provide a platform for people to talk to strangers who share similar
            interests or just chat for the fun of it.
        </p>

        <p>

            It is fact that so many people don't like to make small talk but random chat with strangers and
            acquaintances
            can help you strengthen your mental health. You can know about different people from different
            countries, races, gender, background, and cultures.
        </p>




        <p>
            According to Gillian Sandstrom, Ph.D., social
            interaction with strangers and acquaintances can refine and improve our well-being.

        </p>
        <p>

            automatically connect you with the anonymous user on the web waiting for someone to connect. Below
            we have explained the steps you need to follow to start a random chat with a stranger.

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open random chat site on any device.</li>
            <li>Click on the video chat button if you want to chat via video or click on the text chat button if
                you want to chat via text only.</li>
            <li>After this you can click on the start button to initiate the conversation in the next window.
            </li>
            <li>After that wait for the anonymous user to connect.</li>
            <li>Once the user is connected you can start your conversation.</li>
            <li>Click on the shuffle or dial button to leave the current conversation and connect with the new
                user.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

            You can
            connect with the anonymous user via video, voice, and text. When you have finished your
            conversation with the random user you can click on the shuffle button to end the conversation with

            Why Use Random Chat?
        </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="introtext">
        <p>

            Today it is very easy to find the people that you already know about. You can follow them like
            their
            photos, videos, and other content they post. But the limitation of traditional social media is that
            you can only interact with the people you know it.

        </p>

        <p>
            It can be challenging to find a stranger on social
            media or the web who is willing to talk with other people and talk about topics related to
            their interests. This is one of the main reasons to use a random chat site like this.

        </p>

        <p>There are many other social media sites available on the internet like <a
                href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a>,
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a>, <a
                href="https://www.snapchat.com/">Snapchat</a>,
            and many more. Billions of people use these sites to connect with the
            people they have and stay updated about the things happening in the lives of their friends and
            family, The major drawback of these traditional social media sites is that you can only connect
            with the people you already know.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can use random chat to find and talk
            to
            strangers and make them your friends if they share common interests. You can talk with strangers who
            like
            the same books that you read, love to listen to your favorite music and share common
            philosophies.

        </p>



        <p>
            Another reason you should use a random chat site like this is for creating awareness. As this
            the site is used by a large number of people you can use it to create awareness on various
            topics.

            </li>
            <li><b>Start with small talks.</b> You should start with a small conversation with the stranger and
                avoid making personal questions at the start of your conversation. Don't try to investigate
                their sensitive information. You can try asking general questions or commenting about their
                look in a positive manner. </li>
            <li><b>Ask open-ended questions. </b> During a random chat you should try to ask open-minded
                questions to the anonymous person. Try to keep the conversation light and casual as much as
                possible because this will make the other user feel comfortable with you can you both can
                continue the conversation for a longer time.</li>

            <li><b>Ask them for an opinion. </b>You can the option on some topics as this will help you know and
                understand the other person. If you find that the random person you are talking with has the
                same
